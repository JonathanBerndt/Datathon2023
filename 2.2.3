Answer #1: The total number of school districts is 17,604 according to the Excel file.

Answer #2: The total number of lines in the CRDB csv file is 17,616, which is not equal to the number of school districts the Excel file stated.

Answer #3: The “encoding=cp1252” may be needed because of Latin characters used in some of the data points.

Answer #4: The total number of lines in the SLGA csv file is 18,843 which is not equal to the CRDB csv file because the SLGA file has districts in the same latitude and longitude, while the CRDB file does not.

Answer #5: I trust the SLGA file more because even though there are districts in the exact same place, they are two different districts and should be treated as such.
